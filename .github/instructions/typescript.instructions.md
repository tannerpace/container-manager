# VS Code Copilot Development Instructions for TypeScript

You MUST check compilation output before running ANY script or declaring work complete!

1. **ALWAYS** check the "VS Code - Build" task output for compilation errors
3. **NEVER** run tests if there are compilation errors
3. **NEVER** use `npm run compile` to compile TypeScript files, always check task output
4. **FIX** all compilation errors before moving forward

## TypeScript compilation steps

Typescript compilation errors can be found by running the "VS Code - Build" task, which compiles the VS Code TypeScript sources and the built-in extensions:
- This background task may already be running from previous development sessions
- If not already running, start the task to get real-time compilation feedback
- The task provides incremental compilation, so it will automatically recompile when files change
